## Problem Statement

Problem Statement ID â€“ PY009

LOCAL MARKETPLACE FOR FARMERS

The Local Marketplace for Farmers is a mobile or web-based platform designed to connect local farmers directly with consumers, providing a marketplace to buy and sell fresh, locally grown produce without the need for middlemen. This platform empowers farmers by giving them a direct channel to reach their customers and offer fair prices while allowing consumers to access fresh and affordable produce directly from the source. The platform includes features for price comparison, real-time updates on availability, delivery options, and customer reviews, making it easy for both parties to engage in a smooth and transparent transaction.

## Overview

Our web platform bridges the gap between farmers and consumers, ensuring fair trade, better profits, and fresh produce. By eliminating middlemen, we empower farmers with direct sales, transparent pricing, and efficient logistics, while consumers benefit from affordable, high-quality produce.
